# Tab Manager Extension

## Description

This is a chrome extension that closes tabs that have been inactive for a specific amount of time (Set by you).
It also has an additional functionality of searching through all the open tabs.

Currently it is only available for chrome. I Might not be able to make one for Firefox as Firefox blocks scripts from closing tabs that the script has not opened. If you have any ideas for how I can make this extension for Firefox, please feel free to open up an issue/PR.

Also, currently the icon for the extension is set to the default icons from the chrome documentation. If you have any ideas for a cool icon, feel free to open up an issue/PR.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and then in Google Chome, goto `chrome://extensions`. Enable Developer Mode in the right top corner. Click on 'Load Upacked', navigate to the cloned repository and select any file from that folder.
